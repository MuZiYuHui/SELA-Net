# SELA-Net: Skill-specialized Experts with Bootstrap Latent Consistency for Long-Tailed Recognition

This is the official implementation of our IJCNN 2025 paper:

**"Enhancing Long-Tailed Recognition with Skill-specialized Experts and Bootstrap Latent Consistency"**

We propose SELA-Net, a novel framework designed to address the challenge of extreme data imbalance in long-tailed visual recognition. It features two key modules:
- **Skill-specialized Experts (SE)** for category-specific feature learning
- **Bootstrap Latent Consistency (BLC)** for adaptive feature alignment

## ðŸš§ Code Coming Soon

We are currently organizing and refining the implementation. A clean version of the code with full documentation will be released soon.

Stay tuned and thank you for your patience!
